# Part 4: SD Card Image

In the previous parts of our workshop to build a 64bit Docker OS for the Raspberry Pi 3 we're going through all the steps to create the basic building blocks and components we need:

1. [Bootloader](/part1-bootloader.md) - specific for the Raspberry Pi
2. [Kernel](/part2-kernel.md) - a Linux kernel in 64bit with the current LTS version 4.9.13 compiled and configured for the Raspberry Pi 3
3. [Root Filesystem](/part3-root-filesystem.md) - from HypriotOS based on Debian/Jessie for AARCH64


## TL;DR

Here is the last repo to create the complete SD Card Image https://github.com/DieterReuter/image-builder-rpi64.

You can download and flash the lastet of the SD Card Image from GitHub releases https://github.com/DieterReuter/image-builder-rpi64/releases/latest.

* SD Image = hypriotos-rpi64-v20170303-185520.img.zip
* Nodename = black-pearl
* Username = pirate
* Password = hypriot


## Final words...?

I maybe will write some more details about the build process in a few days. But right now, feel free to use the final SD Card Image you can now download from the GitHub releases https://github.com/DieterReuter/image-builder-rpi64/releases/latest.
